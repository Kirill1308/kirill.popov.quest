The "Text Adventure Game" project is a Maven project that utilizes servlet, JSP, and JSTL technologies. The game is designed as a text-based quest and is based on the logic of player choices and responses to questions.

Gameplay Overview:

Account Creation and Login:

The user initiates the game by creating their account and logging into the system.

Game Start:

The player is presented with a scenario, starting with a question or situation.
Based on the player's response, the game dynamically progresses to the next question or scenario.
If the player answers correctly, they advance to the next question.
If the answer is incorrect, the player is redirected to view their game statistics.

Player Progression:

The game continues with a series of questions, each dependent on the player's previous choices.
Correct answers lead to the next challenge, while incorrect answers prompt a review of the player's statistics.

Game Statistics:

In case of an incorrect answer, the player is redirected to view their game statistics.
The statistics include information such as the number of games played, correct answers, and any other relevant metrics.

Game Reset:

After completing the game or reviewing statistics, the player has the option to start a new game, resetting their progress.
